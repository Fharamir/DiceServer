# DiceServer
Server-side app for rolling dice remotely, this app needs "DiceClient" to be complete

# Some more info
This is a 2-app software composed by a client and a server. These tools will help players to play dice-based games (like D&D) via internet (we used to play via Skype).
This is the server software; it will simply listen on port no. 44455 waiting for rolls coming from the clients.
This person who is running the server will see every roll of the connected people. Both clients and server will see the same results from rolls, no one will be able to cheat! :D

Have a nice day :)
